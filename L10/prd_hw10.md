## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Supermarkets need to understand customer purchase patterns to optimize product placement, create effective promotions, and increase basket size. The challenge is identifying which products are frequently bought together in non-obvious combinations.

### 1.2 Solution Overview
Develop an automated system that discovers association rules in transaction data, specifically identifying when purchasing 3 specific products strongly predicts the purchase of 2 other products, measured by the LIFT metric.

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Find at least one valid 3→2 association rule
- Achieve Lift value > 1.2 (indicating meaningful association)
- Process results within reasonable time (<5 minutes)
- Generate clear visualizations and reports

### 3.2 Algorithms

#### 3.2.1 Support Calculation
```
Support(X) = |Transactions containing X| / |Total Transactions|
```

#### 3.2.2 Confidence Calculation
```
Confidence(X→Y) = Support(X∪Y) / Support(X)
```

#### 3.2.3 Lift Calculation
```
Lift(X→Y) = Support(X∪Y) / (Support(X) × Support(Y))
```

### 3.3 Data Structures

```python
# Transaction Matrix
DataFrame: [n_transactions × n_products] binary matrix

# Rule Structure
{
    'antecedent': str,     # "product1 + product2 + product3"
    'consequent': str,     # "product4 + product5"
    'support': float,      # 0.0 - 1.0
    'confidence': float,   # 0.0 - 1.0
    'lift': float         # 0.0 - ∞
}
```
