## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an **Association Rules Mining** algorithm to discover purchase patterns in supermarket transaction data. The goal is to identify combinations of 3 products that, when purchased together, strongly predict the purchase of 2 other specific products.

### Key Metrics Used:
- **Support**: Frequency of itemset occurrence in all transactions
- **Confidence**: Probability of consequent given antecedent  
- **Lift**: Strength of association compared to random chance (our main optimization metric)

---

## 📝 Assignment Requirements

The assignment specifically required:
1. Find association rules where **X contains exactly 3 items** and **Y contains exactly 2 items**
2. Optimize for the **highest possible LIFT value**
3. Use a dataset of 169 unique supermarket products
4. Create visualizations to present findings

---

## 🔬 Solution Approach

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
- Created a binary matrix (1000 transactions × 169 products)
- Each cell contains 0 (not purchased) or 1 (purchased)
- Added synthetic correlations for testing (milk→cereals, bread→butter, pasta→sauces)

### Phase 2: Algorithm Development

#### Initial Approach (Failed)
- Attempted to analyze all 169 products
- **Problem**: 10.9 billion combinations to check! 
- **Result**: Code stuck for 30+ minutes

#### Optimized Approach (Successful)
1. **Reduced scope**: Analyze only top 25-30 most frequent products
2. **Smart filtering**: Calculate support first, eliminate rare items
3. **Progress tracking**: Show completion percentage during execution
4. **Parameter tuning**: 
   - min_support = 0.001 (very low for 5-item combinations)
   - min_confidence = 0.1
   - max_items = 25-30

### Phase 3: Rule Generation & Filtering
- Generate all possible 3-item and 2-item combinations
- Calculate Support, Confidence, and Lift for each rule
- Filter rules with Lift > 1.2 (interesting associations)
- Sort by Lift descending to find best rules

## 💻 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from itertools import combinations
```

### Core Functions

#### 1. Support Calculation
```python
def calculate_support(df, itemset):
    """
    Support(X) = Count(X) / Total Transactions
    """
    mask = df[list(itemset)].all(axis=1)
    return mask.sum() / len(df)
```

#### 2. Confidence Calculation
```python
def calculate_confidence(df, antecedent, consequent):
    """
    Confidence(X→Y) = Support(X∪Y) / Support(X)
    """
    support_xy = calculate_support(df, list(antecedent) + list(consequent))
    support_x = calculate_support(df, antecedent)
    return support_xy / support_x if support_x > 0 else 0
```

#### 3. Lift Calculation
```python
def calculate_lift(df, antecedent, consequent):
    """
    Lift(X→Y) = Support(X∪Y) / (Support(X) × Support(Y))
    """
    support_xy = calculate_support(df, list(antecedent) + list(consequent))
    support_x = calculate_support(df, antecedent)
    support_y = calculate_support(df, consequent)
    return support_xy / (support_x * support_y) if support_x * support_y > 0 else 0
```

### Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Impact | Result |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Limit to top N products | Reduces combinations exponentially | 25 products = 31K combinations vs 50 products = 2.4M |
| Early support filtering | Eliminates rare items upfront | 169 → 25 items |
| Progress tracking | User feedback during long operations | Shows % complete |
| Multiple parameter sets | Finds rules even in sparse data | Try different support/confidence thresholds |

## 📊 Results & Findings

### Final Results
- **Total 3→2 rules found**: 72,980
- **Highest Lift achieved**: ~50+ 
- **Rules with Lift > 1.2**: Thousands of interesting associations

### Visualizations Created
1. **Lift Distribution Histogram**: Shows most rules have Lift 1-5, with rare high-Lift rules
2. **Support vs Confidence Scatter**: Colored by Lift, shows relationship quality
3. **Top 15 Rules Bar Chart**: Highlights best performing rules
4. **Product Correlation Heatmap**: Shows relationships between popular items

### Example Best Rule Interpretation
If Lift = 50 for rule `{A,B,C} → {D,E}`:
- Random chance: 2% would buy D+E
- With pattern: If customer buys A+B+C, nearly 100% chance they buy D+E
- **50x stronger than random!**

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Basic Usage
```python
# Load the code
python association_rules.py

# The script will:
# 1. Generate synthetic data (or load your CSV)
# 2. Find association rules (3→2 pattern)
# 3. Display top rules and create visualizations
# 4. Save results to 'association_rules_3to2.csv'
```

### 2. With Custom Data
```python
# Replace synthetic data generation with:
df = pd.read_csv('your_transactions.csv')  # Must be binary (0/1) format
```

### 3. Parameter Tuning
```python
# Adjust for your data:
min_support = 0.001     # Lower = more rules, slower
min_confidence = 0.1    # Lower = weaker rules included
max_items = 30          # Higher = more combinations, slower
```

## 🔧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Issues
**Problem**: Original code checking 10.9 billion combinations  
**Solution**: Reduced to top 25-30 products → 31K-117K combinations

### Challenge 2: No Rules Found
**Problem**: Parameters too strict for sparse data  
**Solution**: Gradually relaxed thresholds, tried multiple parameter sets

### Challenge 3: Wrong Pattern Rules
**Problem**: Getting 1→1, 2→1 rules instead of required 3→2  
**Solution**: Added strict filtering to ensure exactly 3→2 pattern

### Challenge 4: Sparse Synthetic Data
**Problem**: Random data with 15% purchase probability too sparse  
**Solution**: Added artificial correlations, reduced min_support to 0.001

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

1. **Association Rules** are powerful for market basket analysis
2. **Lift > 1.2** indicates meaningful associations worth acting on
3. **Computational complexity** grows exponentially with items
4. **Smart filtering** and optimization crucial for large datasets
5. **Real transaction data** produces much better patterns than synthetic

## 📝 Files Generated

- `association_rules_3to2.csv` - All 3→2 rules with metrics
- `association_rules.csv` - General rules (if multiple patterns tested)
- Visualization plots (4 graphs showing different aspects)

## 🏆 Assignment Answer

The rule with the **highest Lift value** from the 3→2 pattern analysis is the answer to submit. This represents the strongest association found where purchasing 3 specific items predicts purchasing 2 other items with confidence far exceeding random chance.
