## Claude Code Overview

This document provides a guide for setting up and using the Claude CLI for coding assistance.

---
### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Version 18 or newer
* **Account**: A Claude.ai (recommended) or Anthropic Console account

---
### Installation

To install the Claude Code command-line tool, use the following commands based on your operating system:

* **macOS, Linux, WSL**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
* **Windows PowerShell**: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
* **Windows CMD**: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd`
* **Alternatively**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Setup Notes

If `~/.local/bin` is not in your system's PATH, you can add it by running the following command:

`export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"`

### Running `sudo` with Claude CLI in WSL

For a smoother development experience, it's recommended to configure passwordless `sudo` in WSL to avoid continuous password prompts.

#### Passwordless Sudo (Recommended for Dev)

To configure your user for passwordless `sudo`, run this command in your WSL terminal (as your normal user):

`echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/dont-prompt-$USER-for-sudo-password`

This command adds a rule that allows your user to run any command with `sudo` without being prompted for a password.

#### Test the configuration:

To verify that passwordless `sudo` is working, run the following command. It should print 'root' without asking for a password.

`sudo whoami`

### Getting Started with the Claude CLI

1.  **Navigate to your project**: `cd [...your-awesome-project....]`
2.  **Start Claude**: `claude` (You will be prompted to log in on first use).
3.  **To exit**: Type `/exit`.
4.  **Create a `CLAUDE.md` file**: Run `/init` to generate a file with instructions for Claude.

### Tips for Using the CLI

* Mount your Windows C drive to your Linux home folder to access it easily. For a permanent mount with a link named `CDrive`, use a prompt like: "mount my C: drive permently and add link to my linux home folder with the link name CDrive"
* Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands, and Git.
* Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results.

### WSL User Home Folder

The default Windows path for a WSL user home folder is:

`\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\rmisegal`
